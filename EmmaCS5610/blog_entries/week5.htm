<h1>learn to use Ajax</h1>
<p>Ajax is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.</p>
<p>I made five experiments this week:</p>
<p>1. How to use Ajax to update a part of the page</p>
<p>2. How to retrieve data from XML file</p>
<p>3. How to use AJAX to show suggestions according to the input of user</p>
<p>4. How to use Ajax get the relative information of the request</p>
<p>5. How to combine Ajax and JSON</p>
<p>In these experiments, I understand what the asynchronous means and also know the benefits of update a page
without reload it.</p>
