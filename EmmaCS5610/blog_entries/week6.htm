<h1>learn to use NodeJS, Express framework and OpenShift</h1>
<p>NodeJS is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p>
<p>I made two experiments this week:</p>
<p>1. How to use NodeJS and Express framework to create and publish website?</p>
<p>2. How to use NodeJS and OpenShift to create and publish website to the server?</p>
<p>But actually, this two experiments are equals to five experiments as normal.</p>
